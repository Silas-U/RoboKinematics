# RoboKinematics Library

RoboKinematics is a Python library designed to perform kinematic analysis for an n-degree-of-freedom robot manipulator. This library supports both forward and inverse kinematics, trajectory generation, and other essential kinematic functions for robot control.

## Features

- **Forward Kinematics**: Calculate the end-effector's position and orientation based on joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Compute joint angles for a desired end-effector position.
- **Jacobian Computation**: Calculate the robot's Jacobian matrix for velocity analysis.
- **Trajectory Generation**: Create cubic trajectories for smooth motion between joint configurations.
- **Singularity Detection**: Detect and handle singular configurations in robot kinematics.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```
## Usage
## Example: Forward Kinematics

```bash
from RoboKinematics import CreateKinematicModel

# Define Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters for your robot
dh_params = [
    {"frame_name": "link1", "joint_type": "r", "link_length": 0.5, "twist": 90, "offset": 0.2, "theta": 45},
    # Add more joints as needed
]

# Create a kinematic model
robot = CreateKinematicModel(dh_params, robot_name="MyRobot")

# Calculate forward kinematics
joint_angles = [45, 30]  # Example joint angles
transformation_matrices = robot.f_kin(joint_angles)
print(transformation_matrices)
```

## Example: Inverse Kinematics

```bash
# Define the target position for the end-effector
target_position = [0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0, 0, 0]

# Calculate inverse kinematics
joint_angles = robot.i_kin(target_position)
print(joint_angles)
```
## Example: Trajectory Generation

```bash
# Define waypoints for the trajectory
initial_position = [0, 45, 90]
final_position = [90, 45, 0]

# Generate and plot a cubic trajectory
time_steps = [0, 1, 2]  # Define the time steps for each waypoint
trajectory = robot.ptraj(initial_position, final_position, tq=2, time_steps=[0, 0.5, 1], pva=0)
robot.plot(trajectory, time_steps)
```
